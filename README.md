# Task-4-Setup-and-use-a-Firewall-on-Windows-Linux

## Tasks
In kali linux terminal

## Introduction
In this project,  A firewall is a network security device either hardware or software-based which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic. It acts like a security guard that helps keep your digital world safe from unwanted visitors and potential threats.

**Types of rules in Firewall:**

  1.Accept: allow the traffic. 
  2.Reject: block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error”. 
  3.Drop: block the traffic with no reply.
## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of networking.  
- The ability to define network zones and IP addresses.
- Knowledge of common firewall services and logging. 

## Lab Set-up and Tools

### Tools
- **Kali Linux:** Use UFW(Uncomplicated Firewall) an open configuration tool on linux .
- **UFW(Uncomplicated Firewall):** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a command-line tool that simplifies firewall configuration on Ubuntu and Debian-based systems. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing iptables rules, the Linux kernel's packet filtering system.
                                                       **or**
- **Windows Firewall**:Windows Firewall is a built-in network security feature that protects your device by controlling and monitoring network traffic.

### Installation
Install UFW(Uncomplicated Firewall) on a linux system using the command :
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ufw
```

## Tasks
In kali linux terminal
# Setup and use a Firewall .
**Objective:** Configure and test the basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic.
**Tools:** Windows firewall / UFW(Uncomplicated firewall)on linux.
## 1. Enable UFW
Before starting, install and update UFW.To enable UFWuse the command:

 ```sh
sudo ufw enable
```

## 2.List current firewall rules

**Use command:**
 ```sh
sudo ufw status numbered
```

## 3.Add a rule to block inbound traffic on a specific port(e.g., 23 for Telnet)
Block portal 23(Telnet) :
 ```sh
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
```
**Rule added**

## 4.Test the rule
**Try the following commands and it should fail**
 ```sh
telnet localhost 23
```
                        (or)
 ```sh
nc -zv localhost 23
```

## 5.Add rule to allow SSH(port 22)
**Use command:**
 ```sh
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```
**Rule added to allow the port**

## 6.Remove the test block rule 
**To restore the original state by using the command:**
 ```sh
sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
```
**Rule will be deleted and restores to allow 23/tcp**

## 7.Final status 
**Shows the status of firewall after performing the rules**

## 8.Firewall Summary

🧠 Firewall Summary

*A firewall filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules.

*It can block/allow traffic based on IP addresses, port numbers, or protocols.

*Example: Blocking port 23 prevents Telnet connections, which reduces exposure to certain attacks.

*Allowing only essential services, like SSH, reduces the attack surface.
